# Low_Power_Multi-Clock_Configurable_Processing-System
## This fully parametrized system recieves commands via UART and sends the result back to the user. It deals with Clock-Domain-Crossing and gates the ALU Clock to save power.

### It has a Register File and an ALU with the following operations:

### Addition
### Subtraction
### Multiplication
### Division
### AND
### OR
### NAND
### NOR
### XOR
### XNOR
### CMP: A = B
### CMP: A < B
### CMP: A > B
### SHIFT: A >> 1
### SHIFT: A << 1
### Included is a self-checking testbench for the full System.
